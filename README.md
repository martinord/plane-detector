# Plane Detector

This project gathers the code of a small project of a microphone sensor running in a Arduino Nano, connected to a LoRa WAN. The goal is to detect and count the planes that the sensor can hear.

## Quick start

Edit the code and add your keys in hexadecimal format in order to connect the LoRa WAN.

Also, modify the threshold to your needs.
